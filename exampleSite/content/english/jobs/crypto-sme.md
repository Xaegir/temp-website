## About XAEGIR

XAEGIR aims to be the first and largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs in the Middle East. NFTs can be used in gaming, events, digital art, and an endless number of other use-cases. These items are supported by an immutable ledger, which makes them quite unique, mathematically scarce, liquid, and highly extensible for many different real-world applications. At XAEGIR, we're excited about building a brand new economy from the ground up based on true digital ownership.

We are dedicated to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. Our team is from all walks of life and we celebrate differences .

## About the job

XAEGIR is largely a user-driven organization, so you’ll have a seat at the table in influencing the platform, celebrating the culture, and engaging communities around the globe. We are an **all-remote** company, but prefer that you have availability during GMT+3 work hours to facilitate better collaboration with your core team.

For the role of crypto advisor, XAEGIR is looking for an individual with expansive knowledge in the crypto industry that can mentor, advise, guide, and draft business requirements into working plans for future XAEGIR products and services.

An advisor acts as an evangelist for the company, guiding and directing it in all aspects — marketing, technology, legal, economic and public relations.

As this is an advisory role, compensation will be based on equity and additional benefits. There is some flexibility in this, so feel free to propose ideas.
