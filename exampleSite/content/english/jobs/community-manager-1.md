## About XAEGIR

XAEGIR aims to be the first and largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs in the Middle East. NFTs can be used in gaming, events, digital art, and an endless number of other use-cases. These items are supported by an immutable ledger, which makes them quite unique, mathematically scarce, liquid, and highly extensible for many different real-world applications. At XAEGIR, we're excited about building a brand new economy from the ground up based on true digital ownership.

We are dedicated to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. Our team is from all walks of life and we celebrate differences .
