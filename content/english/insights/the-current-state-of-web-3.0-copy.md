# What is Web3? How It Works

> _"Web3 (also known as Web 3.0 and sometimes stylized as web3) is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain technology, which incorporates concepts such as decentralization and token-based economics."_

The above definition is a mouthful. In this article, I'll be explaining exactly what Web3 means, why it exists and how it all works.

## A New Version of the Internet

To understand what Web3 is, we first need to wrap our heads around why there is even a “3” to begin with. Since the internet came into use, we have seen several iterations of it. Web1, Web2 and now Web3 are the ways we name them.

* **Web 1.0** was static desktop web pages.
* **Web 2.0** is interactive content on all platforms and constant connection on all devices. Tracking data and activity in the process.
* **Web 3.0** users will interact with permissionless networks and without a third party.

Web3 is thus the latest version, addressing the problems that Web2 failed to solve. Web2 is the internet most of us know today. Where our personal information gets tracked and traded.

## Privacy and Security

Private information in Web2 is a commodity. Companies in the space provide services in exchange for your personal. They use this data to advertise and study their audiences. Web3 counteracts this in the following ways:

1. Encryption protects personal information and identities. Thus ensuring the user has true ownership of their data.
2. Decentralization. All interactions are peer-to-peer, meaning no "middleman" has access to your activity. Companies like Google are unable to track your information or transactions.
3. No information goes through a third party so governments won’t be able to access your data either.

## Misconception About Web3

Words like "permissionless" and "trustless" get thrown around a lot in reference to Web3. While these terms are accurate, they don't do the definition justice.

The term _"trustless"_ may imply untrustworthiness. But rather, a trustless system simply does not depend on the goodwill of others. This removes the risks of ill-intent or abuse.

The term _"permissionless"_ could create a sense of anarchy or nomadism. While Web3 distinguishes itself from current systems, this only refers to its automation.

I'd be amiss not writing about the scepticism and uncertainty that plagues Web3. The volatility of the market, copy-cats and scammers are all trying their best to ensure Web3's bad rep. These opportunists do exist in the space. But, it's important to remember that they exist in Web2 as well, even more so in fact. Bad experiences and click-bait media are giving the public a distorted view. Compound this with the scarcity of easy-to-read information on Web3, and doubt arises. I always encourage strong research on any topic that the news covers, you need to read between the lines.

## Why Web3 Matters

So far - we've compared Web3 to the previous versions of the internet, its benefits and its problems. But how does it all work? What's the point? Well to answer that we need to take a look at the status quo. Terms like 'web3', 'crypto', 'blockchain', 'NFT' and 'decentralization' get used as blanket terms. But, these words all have significant differences in meaning. The discussion on these meanings focuses on ideology rather than technology.

It's no secret that big tech and social media companies are deep into data hoarding. Listening in on conversations, and ads curated via your age and interests. The can't help but beg the question - does privacy exist? I'm not too concerned with the answer to this question but rather if we're able to control it. Web3 puts the decisions and ownership of data into the hands of the user - ensuring we have the right to decide.
