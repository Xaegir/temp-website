## NFTs

Currently, NFTs have a broad set of use cases around collectables, digital assets in games, digital art, reputation systems among others but represent one of the areas which have taken off and highlighted the power of ownership (and speculation) that web3 can bring.

* OpenSea has over 600K traders on its platform with a trading volume of $3B a month, **growing over 500X from the same time last year**. For context, its trading volume is 3X the size of Etsy, a $30B public company.
* Coinbase announced the launch of an NFT marketplace and already has 3.8M users on its waitlist!
* SolanaArt is doing \~3M per day in trading volume, meaning that even Solana based NFTs are doing >$1B in run-rate trading volume
* FTX also just launched an NFT marketplace, starting first with Solana based NFTs

## Games

Games (especially play-to-earn ones) are another use case that has taken off which provided a precursor for more to come with web3. While the objects within games are either fungible tokens or NFTs, they often serve as a different kind of onramp into Web3 than say NFTs purchased to collect or invest.

* **Axie Infinity**, a play-to-earn game, has over **2.2M monthly active players**. Over a 500M trading volume of tokens has taken place over the last month. In some places such as the Philippines, workers have quit their day jobs and are making a living (sometimes earning double their previous income) playing Axie.
* **SoRare**, a global NFT-based fantasy soccer game, was valued at over $4B and has over **500K users** with essentially no marketing. It has retention in the 70% range and a DAU/MAU ratio of 60%, both incredibly high and comparable to the best Web2 social networks.
* **Decentraland**, a user-owned virtual world that allows users to explore different experiences and games within the world, has a market cap of over $4B and over **100,000 users** who own some land or tokens in the virtual world.

## DAOs

DAOs stand for **decentralized autonomous organizations** and are a way people can co-ordinate around a shared mission or vision. DAOs allow for on-chain governance and decentralized decision-making and ownership. In a web3 world, DAOs are likely to be meaningful if not _the primary_ way that groups of people coordinate to achieve desired outcomes.

* **Assets under Management**: The total **assets under management** of DAOs **is up to \~$14B in 2021**. 1.3M members belong to DAOs, per DeepDao.
* **Use Cases**: DAOs are popping up across a **myriad of use cases**, beyond just protocol and investing. Some of the other use cases include Social DAOs, Charity DAOs, Service DAOs (akin to guilds) as below.
* **Infrastructure**: The infrastructure to support DAOs continues to improve with more and more things popping up to make it easier to handle Formation (DAOHaus), Governance (Snapshot), Treasury Management (Parcel) and Communication (Discourse, Discord) and Coordination (Coordinape).

## Capital

Innovation needs capital, and in crypto and web3 there is no shortage of it.

* **VC funding into Crypto**: In just the first half of 2021, over $17B of venture capital (and growth capital) was invested into crypto, more than double the entirety of 2020, per Bloomberg. Many top VCs are now investing in crypto even if they didn’t prior and the ones that already did have continued to increase the size of their funds.
* **Digital Trusts and Index Funds**: There is over $50B of capital invested in crypto through digital asset trusts and index funds such as Grayscale ($50B), Pantera ($3.8B) and Bitwise ($1.1B).
* **Institutional Involvement**: Over 9000 institutions are using Coinbase to participate in the crypto economy. These institutions hold almost \~$90B on Coinbase alone, and are doing \~**$300B in trading volume** per quarter!
* **Hedge Funds**: Per PWC, the Assets under management for crypto hedge funds doubled to \~$3.8B in 2020.

## Web2

Another proxy for web3 activity is web2 or even traditional corporations explore various ways to get involved. We’re seeing a lot of this activity across companies in commerce, payments, gaming, fashion and entertainment.

* **Brands and NFT drops**: Aside from various Sports leagues licensing out NFT collectables to SoRare and Dapper Labs, many brands such as Nike, Gucci, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana and Warner Music Group have been dabbling in NFTs sometimes tying the NFTs to their physical products.
* **Social: Twitter** has introduced several features such as tipping in crypto and is exploring authentication of NFTs used as profile pictures. Meanwhile, TikTok has explored making popular TikToks on its platform available as NFTs.
* **Payments and Commerce: Shopify** is allowing merchants to sell NFTs through storefronts. Similarly, **Stripe** is re-entering crypto and has created a team to “build out the future of Web3 payments”. Visa has also shown an interest in the space buying up a Cryptopunk and have stated that they are “working on some new concepts and partnerships that support NFT buyers, sellers, and creators”
* **Gaming**: **Ubisoft** plans to create its own blockchain-based play to earn games. Similarly, **EA** has been hiring for roles around NFT and blockchain. **Epic Games** is open to NFT and blockchain-based games on its Games Store, although its first-party games will not be leveraging the technology for now.

## The Knowledge Shortage

There are few people in the grand scheme of things that possess a good understanding of Web3 and exactly what crypto has to offer. Finding an easy-read resource online describing the technology behind Web3 is few and far between. Either you find an article that’s too technical to read past the first paragraph or an oversimplified and largely opinionated piece of work that was written with some kind of ulterior motive - this has created a gap between the Web2 and Web3 worlds that needs to be bridged. Most speculators not involved in the space often associate Web3 with whatever clickbait headline has been fed to them on whatever social media platforms they frequent and thus associate Web3 with terms like rug-pulls, pump and dump schemes and ultimately feed the uncertainty and scepticism in the space. In short, not many people truly understand the space but plenty are giving their opinion on it.

## Sophistication

One of the biggest challenges with Web3 today is the poor UI/UX. Most projects tend to be highly technical. Hence, difficult to understand and act on. In my opinion, that holds back a lot of people from embracing web3 and experimenting in the space.

During the past 10+ years, we got good at designing applications for third-party organizations. Think of apps that help us to manage our finance (banks), identity (governments and social media), transportation (Uber), and accommodation (Airbnb). Suddenly, we have a new paradigm shift. With web3, we manage our wealth without the need for a third party to interfere. In turn, designers struggle to address that complexity.

The same pattern played in both web1 and web2. The first web pages were ugly and hard to use. Likewise, the first versions of Uber/Airbnb/Instagram/Facebook were not great. It takes time to iron out the complexity and develop great UI/UX.

## Limitations

Naturally, as would be expected in any early stages of a technology there are bound to be some limitations or unexplored solutions. Given that everything that gets implemented onto a blockchain or integrated into a smart contract needs to be approved and processed - there is a delay in innovation. Token standards are one example of how the enormous trends and volumes being traded have created stagnation in the development. People are happy with the current opportunities that the market can offer because it is lucrative but this has halted or rather dramatically slowed down new ideas and innovations from being discussed.

## Current Issues

There have a been number of topics or rather problems in the current financial, political and social ecosystems of the world that have been put under a magnifying glass because of the alternatives that decentralization propose.

**Investment:** It’s no secret that banks and other private investment companies generally don’t have the consumer’s best interest at heart but rather are simply a company, and like all companies in a capitalist society, they have one goal above all else - to generate profit. This concept has new prospecting investors second-guessing on whether their capital could be more wisely spent elsewhere and why they need to pay someone just to pay someone else.

**Politics:** Entities like Visa and Mastercard have come under serious scrutiny lately due to their inability to provide objective security to their consumers. An event that highlights this would be the Ukraine Russia event in which millions of people (some not even involved) were left without access to their finances. This has left a huge number of people wondering how (no matter what their nationality or unwilling association with a government is) they can feel secure and acquire true financial independence.

**Crisis:** There are several humanitarian disasters taking place across the globe and despite the prevalence of organizations such as the WHO, UN and other non-governmental entities, the people are still suffering. The problems start with the inability to ensure that relief assets find their way to the actual people in need and are not exploited by intermediary parties. The problems end (but are not resolved) by prospective donators becoming unwilling to continue aid as there is no surety that their help is going to where it was intended.

## Review

The current climate in the Web3 space is suited to new developments and innovation. The industry (although filled with new projects and ideas) has yet to see a truly groundbreaking technology that exists outside of novelty. The true enthusiasts have been discouraged by the uncertainty and lack of transparency in Web3 companies and are waiting for an entity that can build on the fundamental ideology of decentralization while maintaining a user-friendly platform and clear objectives. The uncertainty around Web2 is growing and (if properly executed) could be leveraged into an effective competitive advantage in the market. Innovation in the current trending fields of Web3, such as NFTs and GameFi, should be implemented along with other against-the-norm real-world utilities.
